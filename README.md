# EchoBug

EchoBug gives you instant insight into your code's flow and state. It's a powerful debugging tool that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of your application's execution through a clean, intuitive VS Code interface.

## Features

### Real-Time Request Monitoring

- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across different parts of your application using unique correlation identifiers

### Comprehensive Data Views

- **Messages Tab**: View filtered log messages with timestamps and different severity levels (log, info, warn, error)
